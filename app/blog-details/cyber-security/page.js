                              Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting
                              systems, networks, and data from digital attacks,
                              unauthorized access, and damage. It involves a set

                              to safeguard digital assets and ensure
                              confidentiality, integrity, and availability. With
                              the rise of cloud computing, IoT devices, and
                              mobile technologies, the need for robust
