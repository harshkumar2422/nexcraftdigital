                              Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology
                              (DLT) that allows data to be stored across a
                              network of computers in a way that makes it nearly
                              impossible to alter or hack. Each block in the
                              blockchain contains a set of transactions, and
                              once a block is added to the chain, it is securely
                              linked to the previous block, creating an
                              unchangeable record. The decentralization feature
                              ensures that no single party controls the system,
                              enhancing trust and transparency. Blockchain works
                              on the principle of consensus—participants in the
                              network agree on the state of the ledger, ensuring
                              all transactions are accurate and verifiable.

                          <p>
                            Blockchain is still in its early stages, but its
                            potential is vast. It is expected that in the coming
                            years, blockchain will continue to transform various
                            industries, driving greater decentralization,
                            improving security, and enabling new business
                            models. Emerging technologies like 5G, IoT (Internet
                            of Things), and artificial intelligence (AI) are
                            expected to integrate seamlessly with blockchain,
                            creating new opportunities for innovation.

                            One exciting development is the rise of DeFi
                            (Decentralized Finance), a blockchain-based
                            alternative to traditional financial systems, where
                            individuals can transact directly without relying on
                            banks or other intermediaries.
